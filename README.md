Texts are in folder books and should not be moved to other directory. Nevertheless feel free to change the content of the folder with your books.

File stopwords_en.txt is crucial. DO NOT remove it.

File BEST20TFIDF&DistinctWords.txt is the output of book directory, distinct words in a book and 20 words with highest TF-IDF.

File example.txt is an example of an output in the console. These are books in which words from the list (edit in code) have the highest TF-IDF.

I hope you enjoy my solution!
